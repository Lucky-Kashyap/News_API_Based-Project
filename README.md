# News Application

Features:

- Created clean navbar with logo and various category buttons
- Use News API to fetch data
- Use category to filter news according to category
- You can search news on type something on input box
- Use Bootstrap for creating layout
- Create Footer bar

I will not be hosted this application because according to news api docs you can't deploy on client side you need server for it basically (Node JS) server it runs.

### It runs locally but i configure it in on server side

- that will be challenging but i'll do it.
